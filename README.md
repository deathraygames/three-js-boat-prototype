# three-js-boat-prototype

***An unfinished cannon/boat game for the [32bit Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/32bit-jam-2022)***

This prototype game uses a three js example -- https://threejs.org/examples/?q=wate#webgl_shaders_ocean -- as its base, and adds a boat with a third-person camera based on SimonDev's lesson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuNPHOJ_V5o&t=1s.
